1810,F9: Developer Ecosystem,plu-ts Typescript smart-contracts,https://app.ideascale.com/t/UM5UZBzRk,z_assessor_2242,z_assessor_2242-414103,414103,26597,"The proposal aims to create a library that can construct an AST (Abstract Syntax Tree) of Plutus Core to create smart contracts in typescript. If this could be accomplished, it could undoubtedly be very useful to developers working with typescript, especially for developers coming from other ecosystems like Ethereum. However, I don't understand some of the claims that are being made. The statement, ""this tool would also allow for existing dApp developers to generate smart contracts client-side, resulting in truly decentralized applications that could even be served statically"" seems illogical as the implication of the method of how a smart contract is created doesn't really follow to it being ""truly decentralized""",4,"The proposer seems to have some technical competence and understanding of Plutus and typescript as illustrated in the (somewhat scant) provided github repo for the project. They are also the lead developer on another project, Cardano-Trace, that was funded in Fund 8. Some questions need to be asked about the scope of what is being proposed here and how complicated this actually is. As a seasoned developer myself, my opinion is that what is being proposed is extremely difficult to achieve and would require expert level knowledge of Plutus, that could probably only be achieved from having actively worked on the development of Plutus for a while. The other huge problem here is how to get typescript to express the same semantics that are being used in Haskell - a problem that I would say is a graduate level comp sci. thesis in itself. The proposal does not address either of these issues - considerably large risks and challenges, and cannot see how this project would be feasible with the provided credentials and timeline.",1,"The proposer maintains a github repo for the opensource project which would help keep track of what is being worked on as well as provides good quality youtube videos explaining progress. It is stated that one of the goals to track the success of the project is to track developer adoption, but it is not clear how they plan to go about measuring this.",4,"The assessor seems to have an imperfect understanding of the technical aspects involved in the proposal.

This is evident in the entire assessment, but one particular sentence got my attention, I quote:

""The other huge problem here is how to get typescript to express the same semantics that are being used in Haskell - a problem that I would say is a graduate level comp sci. thesis in itself""

From a computer science theory point of view, in order to express a logic that can be expressed in a Turing-complete programming language (e.g. Haskell) in any other language, the only requisite for the target language is for the latter to be Turing-complete itself (as  typescript is).

The above let me question the effective knowledge of the assessor in the matter of computer science theory.

From a practical point of view, it appears that the assessor did not examine the proposal closely, otherwise they would have understood that the project aims to construct an Untyped Plutus Core program using Typescript, NOT a transpiler from Haskell programs to Typescript ones. 

This drastically reduces the complexity of the program being developed, and a similar approach has already been used in the implementation of known libraries such as Plutarch, proving its feasibility.


I would also like to answer the comment regarding the provenience of the smart contract, I quote:

""seems illogical as the implication of the method of how a smart contract is created doesn't really follow to it being ""truly decentralized""""

The assessor is missing the point on current practices to deploy complex protocols as decentralized applications.

For example, in decentralized exchanges
it is common to need to create a smart contract based on some platform user input (the so-called ""parametrized smart contracts"") as an example in order to set up a pool of a pair of token.

In order to create this smart contract (not known at the moment of platform deployment) the current solution is to set up a server ( a PAB ) that exposes some endpoints that allow for the creation of the above cited smart contract.

Currently the PAB solution is the only applicable one, due to the fact that the smart contract creation is limited to Haskell, which cannot run client side natively, and so is run on a centralized server.

This process centralizes the ""decentralized"" application, and this is why plu-ts will allow to overcome this issue by running on the browser, hence allowing for  ""truly decentralized"" applications.

I sincerely hope to prove this seasoned developer, that what they describe as impossible is more than feasible.",true

Clearly, this will help to onboard Typescript/Javascript developers and hence fulfilling the multiple criterion of this challenge, such as attract more developers from outside of current community, make it easier to create a dApp, enterprise dev managers to build enterprise projects (as a very high percentage of them are familiar with typescript/javascript frameworks).

This library project is not about scalability (so we can ignore that metrics from challenge brief) as the scalability comes from the dApps that will use this library, and since this library is open source and in typescript, for which the developer community is quite huge, there will not be a lack of developers contributing to this repository and hence making it sustainable.

As far as I understand, the proposal wants to flatten the level of transformations between the smart contracts human readable code to the actual execution code. This has it's benefits, like verifying the contract locally, which really is a big deal. Imagine the human readable code passes through a translator or two, to be understandable for the execution environment, this brings more dependencies, which is more risky in general. What the proposer wants to do is create a more direct path for everyone when writing a dapp and a smart contract to be specific.
I do belive that this is a really ambicious idea, and it would have an impact over the community. I also think it's going to be challenging work, that has a possibility of not being good enough if only a partial subset of functionality is implemented, but there's no way of knowing if it's good enough or not before releasing the solution into the real world. There's no other way around it, but having said that, I do believe it's a worthy effort that needs to be tried out. It's in line with the challenge settings and does provide a solution to a very basic problem, that people just take for granted, but development could be better if this solution is implemented. 
Overall I think this is a great idea and would add a missing piece to the development flow. The impact has a really big potential. I don't have any concerns for this proposal besides the few small things I already mentioned. Good luck to the author.
",5,"The budgeting scheme is sound and I do like the project would be opensource. One thing that I found difficult to confirm were the skills of the proposer. I looked through the code in the github repositories, but there isn't anything implemented that would give any assertion for the level of skill. It's mostly documentation updates and nothing logic heavy that could verify the skills. The youtube channel did have some explanations of haskell tutorials and run through of some specifications, but no actual practical (not-examples) code written, which makes it hard for me to verify the skillset necessary for the implementation of the described proposal. That's not to say, the proposer doesn't have the necessary skills, It's just that I couldn't verify them with the resources and information given.
I do like the idea of expanding the team, once the MVP passes, because such a project would need years to mature and actually be mass adopted and usable in production code. The budget has a good breakdown, although I don't see any reasoning behind the 30k for critical code audit, and how this number came to be. This project is really complex and I find it difficult to believe that 1 person can manage the whole development. As a developer myself I know what's in the relm of possibilities and this would be near impossible, no matter how skilled you are, because it's a time problem not a skill problem. The heuristics are simply too big.
I can appreciete the idea, but overall I'm left uncertain if this is a feasible project or not. I tend to be on the sceptical side, but I choose to give the benefic of the doubt, and say I'm just unsure, giving it a score of 3 for that reason.
",3,"I don't have anything to say about the projects' auditability since if it's an open source project, anyone interested in the progress will be able to follow along using the github repository linked in the proposal. The roadmap is present and anyone can try to follow the milestones set by the author. There's a clear problem and a solution so that's good, butt I think more people should be involved in order to get this project to it's fruition.
Overall an auditable project, but I'd suggest to the author to put themselves in the shoes of the voter and read through the proposal again and polishing it in order to be more understandable for the everyday reader and make it more accessible. I wish good luck.

8596,F9: Developer Ecosystem,plu-ts Typescript smart-contracts,https://app.ideascale.com/t/UM5UZBzRk,z_assessor_2856,z_assessor_2856-414103,414103,26597,"- When the era is being strongly developed, the nature of work is enhanced and the difficulty increases, the introduction of Typescript Smart Contracts. is a great thing.

   - In the proposal, I see that the group has raised the issues that are. Currently, smart contract creation is limited to the haskell programming language; This limits the potential of smart contracts. I found the issues the group raised to be well-suited to the challenge. This proposal desperately needs to scale up to address the challenges in the Challenge.

   - Besides, the proposed topic has also raised a lot of its solutions such as, implementing a library that can build AST of Untyped Plutus Core, so that it can be sent with a transaction and processed on-chain... I find the above solutions to be very suitable for solving the problems in the Challenge.

   - With a presentation of the risks that the project may face. I see the team has also raised some of the risks like at the moment, there is no serialization library, to solve the risk on the proposed topic has come up with solutions to reduce that risk a bit. very reasonable way that is. reimplement ``flat'' from the bottom up, and implement a specialized subset. I think the above solutions are reasonable.",4,"- With section providing a detailed plan, including progress and milestones. Here I see the team has identified a specific milestone. That's going to get the job done over a period of eight months. I think with the above time period is completely reasonable to complete the tasks set out. The progress of the project as well as the goals to be achieved have also been stated very specifically as in the aforementioned proposal.

    - In the section provide detailed budget breakdown. With a total budget of $105,840 and already expenses for things like. project development, data warehouse maintenance, and some other costs. I find such cost divisions to be reasonable.

    - About providing detailed information about the people who will work on the project. Here I see the new group raised one member. Through research, I found this member's working capacity as well as experience is very good. This member's identity is also easily verifiable.",4,"- With a description of what you will measure to track your project progress. I see 2 main indicators yet that is, the project will be open source, so anyone with an internet connection can verify it. and updates will be published on my Youtube channel weekly. I find such indicators to be very complete and reasonable. However, it is not easy for the community to track these indicators.

    - In the Success section of this project what does it look like? there have been few successes yet such as will see 1 or 2 large projects taking advantage of client side smart contract generation, and developer adoption of this tool. I find the successes cited to be very relevant to the challenge.


    - Regarding funding. This is a new project that has not been funded, but as a PA I find this proposal very good and meaningful. I hope the proposal will be successful.",4,"I'm glad you overall liked the idea

given the average vote I was expecting something you'd like to see implemented, but I wasn't able to find any of such feedback;

If is it ok for you, feel free to reach me out in case you missed to report these feedbacks.

overall thank you for your assesment.",
